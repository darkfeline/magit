  a162b8a71e

** Changes since v3.3.0

- Added new function ~git-commit-turn-on-orglink~ intended for use in
  ~git-commit-setup-hook~.  d122f15edd

- ~git-commit.el~ no longer depends on ~dash~.  bb7b7a4020

- Renamed ~magit-keep-region-overlay~ to ~magit-section-keep-region-overlay~.
  7a94132384

- Some repository and submodule list columns got a bit fancier.
  3f3980735f 451438dc90

- Refreshing a repository or submodule list buffer now restores the previous
  position.  1feda0cb1c

- Added new variable ~magit-submodule-list-predicate~. ceab3124fb

- ~magit-diff-dwim~ uses a more useful range when showing unpushed and unpulled
  changes.  9413847c1a

- Added new face ~git-rebase-action~ to allow customization of the face used for
  the action words in git-rebase-todo files.  #4544

- Added built-in faces ~diff-refine-added~ and ~diff-refine-removed~ to the
  ~magit-faces~ Custom group.  6da7771b61

- When invoked with a prefix argument ~magit-fetch-modules~ now acts as a
  transient prefix command.  fd5b9eadf3

- Added new face ~magit-branch-warning~ and improved related faces.  bf3bcbe051 ff

- ~magit-cherry-branch~ now supports using a detached HEAD as source.  ff3269814c

- ~git-commit-save-message~ now reports whether the message was actually saved.
  dfe3d03a14

- Added new commands ~git-commit-search-message-backward~ and
  ~git-commit-search-message-forward~.  #4537

- Added ~--ff-only~ to ~magit-pull~.  f766f68f78

- Make use of ~with-connection-local-variables~, and for older Emacsen use a
  stripped down implementation. #4568

- Added new functions ~version>~ and ~version=~ using the names ~magit-version>~ and
  ~magit-version=~.  My brain is too small to always get yoda conditions right,
  while the Emacs maintainers have huge brains, and as a consequence have
  rejected the addition of these functions on grounds of them being unnecessary.
  I don't want to make such mistakes anymore, so I am forced to define these
  functions myself.  I guess this makes me a Sith.  c8c2efd014, 6e86f36ead

- Added ~--ignore-date~ to ~magit-rebase~.  7f03f572d5

- Added new command ~magit-log-related~.  c33ed664e6

- New transient ~magit-sparse-checkout~ provides an interface to the
  ~git sparse-checkout~ command, introduced in Git v2.25.  #4102

- New command ~magit-clone-sparse~ makes it possible to clone a repository and
  then immediately enable a sparse checkout, avoiding a checkout of the full
  working tree.  #4102

- The ~magit-clone~ transient now includes ~--filter~ (hidden by default) to support
  partial cloning, a feature that is available as of Git v2.17.  #4102

- Added new command ~magit-stash-push~, which allows specifying a list of files to
  be stashed.  #4583

- Added some forward compatibility for SHA-256.  #4585

- Added ~magit-mode-bury-buffer~ to ~magit-dispatch~.  5a2624985a

- Added ~--force-rebase~ to ~magit-rebase~.  73b44644f6

- ~magit-tag-release~ learned to extract the version string from the HEAD commit's
  message.  429d5c55e8

- ~magit-turn-on-auto-revert-mode-if-desired~ performs cheaper checks first now.
  #4591

- Added new face ~magit-section-child-count~.  #4599

- Improved version display and sorting in repository list buffers.
  53199f2dd5, 68be0584f4

- Added support for marking repositories in repository list buffers and acting
  on the marked repositories.  #4453

- Improved internals of the version/feature check caches.  On the user visible
  side, teach ~magit-zap-caches~ to zap everything, when invoked with a prefix
  argument.  #4603

- Rewrote Imenu support, which resulted in a few new features and much less
  code.  4727dcbe22 ff

- For performance reasons the "margin" style sadly had to be removed from
  ~magit-blame-styles~.  608242086e

- When blaming, neighboring chunks about the same commit are now combined into
  just one chunk.  #4030

- Added new command ~magit-git-mergetool~.  #4128

- Taught ~magit-diff-dwim~ about commits of submodules shown in the status buffer
  of the super-repository.  #4151

- A cherry pick or revert can now be continued when there are unstaged changes
  as long as there are no unresolved conflicts, a behavior that more closely
  matches the command line behavior.  #4615

- For the longest time (which is why I don't consider this a bug fix) toggling
  a section caused point to move to the beginning of that section.  Stop doing
  that unless absolutely necessary.  9d8d5e5603

- ~magit-ediff-read-files~ now tries to detect renames in one-file logs.
  b32521d543

- Increased use of section type, keymap and binding inheritance.
  70b34f08ab

- The menu-bar menu, which was severely neglected for many years, finally got a
  makeover.  It no longer offers a completely random subset of Magit's features.
  Now it can be used to invoke most of the commands that could also be invoked
  using ~magit-dispatch~; but by means of a small furry animal.  5641d3749c

- Added many context menus, which can be invoked using the mouse or a key
  (~menu~ by default) and are a great way to discover context sensitive commands.
  Unfortunately this isn't enabled by default.  In Emacs 28 and greater, the
  new global mode ~context-menu-mode~ has to be enabled.  Set
  ~magit-section-show-context-menu-for-emacs<28~ to ~t~ if you are still using an
  older release.  #4645

- Depend on the Compat package, allowing me to use convenient features that were
  added to Emacs over the last few years, without having to wait another few
  years until everybody has updated to a reasonably recent Emacs release.
  571b4346c1

- Added new option ~magit-openpgp-default-signing-key~.  4eed9e1a45

- Added new command ~magit-toggle-git-debug~.  2ed5a06d08

- Tag messages and signatures are now turned into sections in commit buffers.
  476383fc8f

- Work has began on making internal circular dependencies a thing of the past.

- The help text displayed in ~git-rebase-mode~ buffers got a makeover.
  670dad14b5 ff

- Added new command ~magit-ediff-resolve-all~, an alternative to
  ~magit-ediff-resolve-rest~ (formerly known as ~magit-ediff-resolve~).  The
  new option ~magit-ediff-dwim-resolve-function~ controls which is used by
  ~magit-ediff-dwim~ (the new command ~magit-git-mergetool~ is another option).
  #4348

- Improve the diff shown while committing.  #3246

- Register a ~bookmark-handler-type~ for our handler.  adf5848ea7

- Added new option ~magit-log-merged-commit-count~. #4711

  that employ different URL schemes.  #4738
